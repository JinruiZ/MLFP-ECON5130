## Units

This introductory course consists of several units. Each unit corresponds
to one interactive Jupyter notebook, which is also available
as a static PDF file. Alternatively, you can download the entire course as a 
**[single PDF](latex/MLFP-part1.pdf)**.

1.  Language and NumPy basics [[PDF](latex/unit01.pdf)]
2.  Control flow and list comprehensions [[PDF](latex/unit02.pdf)]
3.  Reusing code - Functions, modules and packages [[PDF](latex/unit03.pdf)]
4.  Plotting [[PDF](latex/unit04.pdf)]
5.  Advanced NumPy [[PDF](latex/unit05.pdf)]
6.  Random number generation and statistics [[PDF](latex/unit06.pdf)]
7.  Handling data with pandas [[PDF](latex/unit07.pdf)]
8.  Data input and output [[PDF](latex/unit08.pdf)]
9.  Error handling (optional) [[PDF](latex/unit10.pdf)]

## Installation

### Running without installation

Click on the ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) button
above to use the notebooks directly in your web browser 
(in might take a while to set up the environment). No local
Python installation is required.

### Running locally

#### Download the repository contents

If you are familiar with git, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardfoltyn/MLFP-ECON5130.git
```
Otherwise, download the contents as a ZIP file by clicking on
![Code](images/gh-code.png) above.

#### Install Anaconda

On Windows, you need to install a local Python environment such as 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). On Linux,
your distribution comes with Python but the required packages are most likely
outdated, so it is still recommended installing Anaconda.

##### Windows

Once Anaconda is installed, click on _Jupyter Notebook_ in the Start menu
and navigate to where you extracted the repository contents. Select
`index.ipynb` to run the main notebook.

##### Linux

You need to create a new Python environment which contains all the 
required packages. You can use the specification provided in [environment.yml](environment.yml)
to accomplish that:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the virtual environment you just created:
```bash
conda activate python-statistics
```
To start the Jupyter notebook server, navigate to where you extracted
the repository contents and run
```bash
cd path/to/repository
jupyter notebook index.ipynb
```
